# junctor

Right now, this is just a project that is slowly evolving as I learn through some material.

> This is a project for [nRF52840-DK](https://www.mouser.ca/ProductDetail/Nordic-Semiconductor/nRF52840-DK?qs=F5EMLAvA7IA76ZLjlwrwMw%3D%3D).

Eventual goals are some mesh networking, some sensor collection, and some data processing.

### Usage

This project only supports Ubuntu 20.04 right now.

You can emulate a full CI run, which will properly set up your machine, including installing all `apt` packages, bootstrapping Rustup, setting up the necessary tools, and getting Python untangled.

```bash
make ci
```

Once you've done that, I suggest you enjoy the `make help` command.

If you're on Ubuntu 20.04, these should all just work and I'd love it if you reported a bug if they didn't.

## Mentoring Available / Requested

I'm learning at my own pace on this through [The Embedded Trainings 2020](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020) series from Ferrous Systems.

If you're someone who doesn't really know what all this is, and you want to learn about it with me, let me know. You can [email me](mailto:operator@hoverbear.org) if you don't want to post publicly on issues.

If you want to mentor me and/or others who might get involved, I'd love it if you opened an issue and said hi! I frequently like to rubber ducky debug against live humans, and people seeing that they might have some help beyond me might encourage them to try things out.
