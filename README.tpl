## Mentoring Available / Requested

I'm learning at my own pace on this through [The Embedded Trainings 2020](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020) series from Ferrous Systems.

If you're someone who doesn't really know what all this is, and you want to learn about it with me, let me know. You can [email me](mailto:operator@hoverbear.org) if you don't want to post publicly on issues.

If you want to mentor me and/or others who might get involved, I'd love it if you opened an issue and said hi! I frequently like to rubber ducky debug against live humans, and people seeing that they might have some help beyond me might encourage them to try things out.

## Contributing

* Please commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). I provide Git hooks and Make targets to help you, please use them!
* Please don't get mad if I say something isn't in scope and close it! I'm just hacking!
